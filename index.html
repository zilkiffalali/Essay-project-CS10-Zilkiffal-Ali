        <p>I have always been tall, decidedly tall. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height. Starting at a young age, I would ask countless questions,
           from “How heavy is the Earth?” to “Where does rain come from?” My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly defined me as a person and as a student.
           Therefore, it is not surprising that I became transfixed the first time I played 20Q (the

            ). Somehow,
            a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking.
            The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in 20Q. This interest would later reveal valuable character
            traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life..</p>

        <h2>“Does it strive to learn?”</h2>
        <h3>“Yes.”</h3>
        <p>I became determined to discover how 20Q guessed correctly. After some research, I discovered artificial intelligence,
          more specifically, artificial neural networks—systems which learn and improve themselves.
           This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could.
            When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me.
             I found myself in an environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps,
              and work over

           Throughout high school, I applied the “secret” of practice to my basketball career.
           I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90° summer heat to 20° late-winter cold, countless afternoons playing pickup games with my friends,
            and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments. As a result,
             I became a starter for my school’s

             . I applied another “secret,”
             this time the “secret” of perseverance, by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery
            in order to quickly return to football. Later that year, I became the first
            player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown.</p>

           . At first I was
            mediocre. However, through long car rides with family, good-natured
             yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy, and time, I
             became more effective. I discovered the “secrets” to success: practice
             and perseverance.</p>

          , rationality and interpersonal skills.
          I have found that, as in Twenty Questions, always succeeding is impossible; however, by persevering through difficulties and obstacles,
          favorable outcomes are often attainable. As I have become better at Twenty Questions, so too have I improved in many other aspects of my
          life. Nonetheless, I realize that I still have unbounded room to grow. And much like 20Q, I will continue to learn throughout my life and
           apply my knowledge to everything I do.</p>
